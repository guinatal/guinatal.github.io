title: ES6: Why to write a good code?
---

A few weeks ago, I came across this image above and because of that I’ve decided to write this post, showing the importance of writing a good code.

## What does “a good code” mean?

I think the variables may change slightly depending on the language we are using, but there are some general rules that apply to all languages.

### There are some points:

- When you have to add or modify a feature, is it too difficult?
- Do you constantly break existing functionality when making changes?
- Is it hard to understand some code that you are seeing for the first time?

If you’ve answered ”yes”, you need to start reviewing your code.

## Why to write a “good code”?

Doesn’t matter if we are talking about client side or server side. The consequences of writing a bad code can be terrible for the developer himself.

### “What is my code doing?”
This question seems to be crazy, but I am sure that you have already asked yourself.

### “It is just a text field, should be easier to implement”
Yes, sometimes an easy thing can become a problem or take a long time to implement.

### “I just modified that and nothing else works.”
Functions and code blocks should be well defined and isolated, so you would not destroy the whole system when editing a single line.

## How to write a “good code”?

- Plan Before You Write
- Commenting & Documentation
- Good Indentation
- Avoid Deep Nesting
- Consistent Variable Names
- Code Refactoring

If you do not know some concept above, please just google it. I’ve listed a few important ones, but there are a lot more.

## Conclusion

Try to challenge yourself in writing a better code. Ask for help from a more experienced developer on how you could improve your code. And the most important, before writing the code, think about the best way to do it, even if it takes a few precious minutes, I’m sure it will be worth it.
